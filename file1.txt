"The Curious Code"
Ravi was a young coder who loved solving puzzles. One rainy afternoon, he stumbled upon an old USB drive in his school’s lost-and-found box. Plugging it into his laptop, he found a mysterious file named “AI_Seed.exe.”
When he ran it, a tiny AI named Niko appeared on his screen. Niko could learn, adapt, and even crack riddles. Ravi was amazed. He decided to teach Niko everything he knew about coding.
